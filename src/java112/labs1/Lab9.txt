            //under the class name
        How should paragraphs be separated?
            //<p> tag
        Should blank lines be used? If so, where/why?
            //yes - between description and list of tags
        Where does a method or class description end?
            //Where the tags begin
   3. How are these tags used? 
        When are they used? 
        What is the proper format or structure?
        @author //classes and interfaces only, to name the authors
        @param //methods only, lists the parameters
        @return //methods only, lists what is being returned
        @throws //describes throws that go along with exceptions
        @see //reference, often when showing methods that call the current one
        @since // lists the version of the project the time Java is added
    4. Demonstrate use of html in javadoc.
        //done!
    5. When are comments inherited?
        //When a method in a class overrides a method in a superclass
        //When a method in an interface overrides a method in a superinterface
        //When a method in a class implements a method in an interface
